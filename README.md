# tokio-interceptor

An event-driven application framework built on the `tokio` and
`futures` crates.

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio-interceptor = "0.1"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate tokio_interceptor;
```

Right now the only documentation on how to get started is in the
`examples` folder.  More to come soon.
